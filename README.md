# ATM

This is an ATM program with SQLite3 integration. The user will be prompted to set up their account, using basic information. The user will then be provided with their new account information, inlcuding a pin, which is required to access the account.
The program also has a feature in which the user can view their transactions, which includes information such as amount deposited/withdrawn and time/date of transaction, obtained using the datetime module.

The user can also close their account, which deletes all account information from the database.
